### **Identification Column**

In this section, the distribution family of the response variable and the column corresponding to the id or identifier of the repeated observations are defined.
As *GEE* models are based on the use of repetitive samples, either over time or taking into account samples related to each other, it is necessary to identify repeated/related observations. The user should select the column that **identifies** these same repetitive observations.
