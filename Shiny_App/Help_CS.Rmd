### **Correlation Structure**

In this section the **correlation structure** is defined, this structure is necessary to describe the existing correlation between the observations. The user can choose one of the three available structures. If there is any doubt in the choice of the correlation structure by the user, he will have access to the values of **QIC** and **QICu** for each structure by selecting the box **Show QIC values**, the structure that presents the smallest value of **QIC** will be, by definition, the most appropriate correlation structure, if the values are close, the same criterion can be applied for the metric of **QICu**.
Note: To be able to visualize these metrics all other variables will have to be selected in the previous sections.
