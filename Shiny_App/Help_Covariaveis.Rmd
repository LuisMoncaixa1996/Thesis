### **Covariables**

In this section, the model response variable is selected, as well as its associated covariates. The variables will be added to the model after clicking on the respective buttons to save.
The **covariates** can be selected in two ways, from the selection boxes presented where the selected covariates will be added to the model as shown in the following example: (Sex + Age + Dilation + etc...), and by introduction of an expression of the covariates in the respective text box, being mandatory the introduction of the exact names of the columns corresponding to the selected covariates. 
**Note:** Only one of the ways to indicate the covariates will be considered, if both ways are used, the expression written by the user will be used.
