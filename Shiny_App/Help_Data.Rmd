### **Data Split**

This section represents the *ROC* validation of the *GEE* models build, in order to test the *accuracy* and obtain the *AUC* of each model to be validated, initially a division of the dataset under test and training will have to be defined. There are 3 different divisions of the dataset, the user can select one of the presented ones. In order to obtain consistency and allow a more precise analysis, the selected division will be the same for all the models selected in the previous menu. In order to confirm the division, the user must press the **Run ROC** button. The **ROC: GRAPH VISUALIZATION** section presents the *ROC* curves generated from the analysis performed, these curves can be downloaded to the user's local computer with the model name, previously defined by the user. In the last section **ROC RESULTS** the values of *Accuracy* and *AUC* of each model selected for *ROC* validation will be presented.
